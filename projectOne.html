					this is placeholder text for the map generation project i've written in python. this section will have a written description of the project and exactly what it is and how it works. for now this is all you get.

				<p style = "padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px; padding-top: 10px;">
					i'll probably have some more text down here, too. it could go into more depth about the project and stuff like that. idk i just think it looks good to have text on both sides of the image.
